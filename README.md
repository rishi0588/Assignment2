# Machine Learning Model Streamlit App

This is a Streamlit application that provides machine learning model predictions using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Apriori Association Rules.

## Models
- Linear Regression: House Price Prediction
- Logistic Regression: Iris Classification
- Naive Bayes: Iris Classification
- Decision Tree: Iris Classification
- Apriori: Association Rule Mining
